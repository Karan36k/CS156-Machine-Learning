### 1. Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Bernoulli Distribution

Suppose we have a random sample $X_1, X_2,..., X_n$ where:

- $X_i = 0$ if a randomly selected student does not eat meat, and
- $X_i = 1$ if a randomly selected student does eat meat.

Assuming that the $X_i$ are independent Bernoulli random variables with unknown parameter $p$, derive the maximum likelihood estimator of $p$, the proportion of students who eat meat.
